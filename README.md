## Assignment Overview

This site...isn't going to start out very stylish. That's okay, though! We want to mimic the process of creating the skeleton/architecture for a site *before* incorporating styles and functionality. Read the client brief below and see the attached files from the design team. Remember, you're just thinking about *how* you would want to architect your site and the different semantic HTML elements you'll need. You'll be working on this assignment incrementally throughout this unit; you'll also be working solo, but can seek help from your classmates or teacher. 

## Client Brief

Our client for this assignment is a local nursery. They're seeking a better online presence and want to showcase their great personal design aesthetic and, hopefully, have that mimicked with their website. The design team has worked with them to scaffold out a site map and a prototype of both the desktop and mobile verions of their site; the next step is for you as the developer assigned to this project to sacffold out the necessary HTML.

## Deliverables 

 - [ ] Organized directory with all necessary HTML files <br />
 - [ ] All media assets loaded into the directory <br />
 - [ ] All copy (text) and media inserted under appropriate, semantic HTML tags <br />
